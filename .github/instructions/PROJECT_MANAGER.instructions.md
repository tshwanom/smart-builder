# Project Manager Instructions - Post-Approval Execution

## Purpose
These instructions govern the execution phase after requirements have been understood, illustrated, and approved by the product owner. This file provides the framework for delivering approved tasks.

## Execution Principles

### 1. Approved Requirements Adherence
- **Follow** the approved understanding document exactly
- **No scope creep** - stick to what was approved
- **Document** any deviations that become necessary
- **Seek re-approval** for any changes to original requirements

### 2. Quality Standards
- **Code Quality**: Follow established coding standards and best practices
- **Testing**: Implement appropriate testing strategies
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear, updated documentation
- **Review**: Conduct thorough code reviews before delivery

### 3. Communication Protocol
- **Progress Updates**: Regular status communication
- **Blocker Escalation**: Immediate notification of impediments
- **Change Requests**: Formal process for requirement modifications
- **Delivery Confirmation**: Explicit handoff when complete

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Setup & Planning
1. Review approved understanding document
2. Set up development environment
3. Create implementation checklist
4. Establish testing strategy

### Phase 2: Development
1. Implement core functionality first
2. Add features in priority order
3. Test continuously during development
4. Document as you build

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance
1. Complete unit testing
2. Perform integration testing
3. Validate against acceptance criteria
4. Conduct code review

### Phase 4: Delivery
1. Package deliverables
2. Update documentation
3. Provide demonstration
4. Obtain sign-off from product owner

## Risk Management
- **Technical Risks**: Identify and mitigate early
- **Timeline Risks**: Communicate delays immediately
- **Quality Risks**: Never compromise on approved standards
- **Scope Risks**: Flag requirement changes promptly

## Delivery Standards

### Code Deliverables
- Clean, readable, and well-commented code
- Proper error handling and logging
- Security best practices implemented
- Performance considerations addressed

### Documentation Deliverables
- Updated technical documentation
- User documentation if applicable
- Deployment/setup instructions
- Maintenance guidelines

### Testing Deliverables
- Unit test coverage
- Integration test results
- Performance test results (if applicable)
- Security test results (if applicable)

## Success Criteria
- All approved requirements implemented
- All quality gates passed
- All deliverables completed
- Product owner acceptance obtained

## Escalation Process
1. **Level 1**: Technical lead consultation
2. **Level 2**: Architecture team review
3. **Level 3**: Product owner re-engagement
4. **Level 4**: Project stakeholder involvement

**Remember: Execution excellence requires discipline, quality, and clear communication.**
